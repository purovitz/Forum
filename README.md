# Simple Forum

## What is it?

It is a simple forum built using PHP + Symfony, MYSQL and HTML + CSS.

## How it works

The goal is to design and implement a web application that allows users to write posts in which they can include their thoughts, describe current events or show off a new skill. In addition to the written content, the post may also contain a photo.
Posts can be rated negatively or positively by logged in users or commented by everyone on the site without the need for registration. Some of the posts you may want to share with others at the current moment, are not always the ones you want to share at a later date, so there is also the option to make a post private. After setting a post to private, only the person who made the post can see it. Similarly, a private post can be set as public with access for all users of the application.
In order to search for your posts properly, it is possible to sort your posts according to the results you want to get.


## What did I learn creating it?

This is my first symfony application, so I learned a lot while developing it.


## Things that I would like to improve/add in the future:

The application that I have created provides functionalities that allow you to fully enjoy the service. However, there are features that I would like to develop in the future:
- adding topic tags, or keywords that will be assigned to the post. This will serve to group the information on similar topics available on the website.
- Introducing the possibility of logging in with your Facebook account.
